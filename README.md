Gnome-OSRS-Client
=================

A basic Oldschool Runescape client that resizes/crops the screen and has a few visual effects. 
WARNING: Messy, un-commented and hard to read code.


How to run the client without Launch Gnome Client.sh/.bat:

-Compile GnomeCanvasOverride files in to GnomeCanvasOverride.jar
-Run Main.class with the VM option -Xbootclasspath/p:"GnomeCanvasOverride.jar"
